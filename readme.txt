Abstract:
The abundance of nitric oxide (NO)
synthesizing enzymes identified in the vertebrate retina highlight the
importance of NO as a signaling molecule in this tissue. Here we
describe opposing actions of NO on the rod and cone photoreceptor
synapse. Depolarization-induced increases of calcium concentration
in rods and cones were enhanced and inhibited, respectively, by the
NO donor S-nitrosocysteine. NO suppressed calcium current in cones
by decreasing the maximum conductance, whereas NO facilitated rod
Ca channel activation. NO also activated a nonselective voltageindependent
conductance in both rods and cones. Suppression of NO
production in the intact retina with NG-nitro-L-arginine favored cone
over rod driven postsynaptic signals, as would be expected if NO
enhanced rod and suppressed cone synaptic activity. These findings
may imply involvement of NO in regulating the strength of rod and
cone pathways in the retina during different states of adaptation.

To use the model simply auto-launch from ModelDB or 1)download archive
and expand the zip file, 2) compile the mod files with mknrndll
(mswin) or nrnivmodl (unix/linux), and 3) start the program by double
clicking the mosinit.hoc file (mswin), or by typing nrngui mosinit.hoc
(unix).

The simulation will reproduce figure 4.
